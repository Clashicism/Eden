# Gateway

Simple Bitcoin Payments

## Overview

Gateway is a payment processor enabling merchants to easily accept
Bitcoin Cash on their sites without the need for hassle or technical
know-how. Check out the [Gateway Project Charter](CHARTER.md)
for our roadmap, use-cases and a lot more info.

## Development

The project is being hosted across multiple repositories.
Depending on how you'd like to contribute, you may be interested
in one of the following:

- [Gateway Payment Button](https://github.com/gatewaycash/website)
- [Backend Server API](https://github.com/gatewaycash/api)
- [The Gateway.cash Website](https://github.com/gatewaycash/website)
- This repository contains graphics, project resources, roadmaps and
investor materials

If there is a feature or issue you'd like resolved, please open
an issue for it so that it gets worked on. You may open the issue
here, or you may send it to the repo where you think it is most
relevant. Either way, we'll categorize it and get it worked on as 
soon as we can.

If you'd like to work on something, please assign the appropriate
issue to yourself beforehand.

Note that we may move new issues to a more appropriate repo during
the classification process.

## Weekly Community & Development Meetings

There are also weekly community meetings to discuss development, 
ideas and tech every Saturday at 9AM PST (17:00 UTC) in the voice 
channel. All parties are welcome.

Gateway is accepting donations to fund development, accelerate
adoption and pay bounties to developers who work on certain tasks.
Donations are made and bounties are paid in Bitcoin Cash.

Our donation and bounty payout address is a secure two-of-three

project.
