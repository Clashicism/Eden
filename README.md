# Gateway

Simple Bitcoin Payments

## Overview

Gateway is a payment processor enabling merchants to easily accept
Bitcoin Cash on their sites without the need for hassle or technical
know-how. Check out
the [Gateway Project Charter](CHARTER.md)
for a lot more info.

## Development

Please refer to the Project Charter linked above for an up-to-date
list of things that need work. Please review it before contributing.

A more traditional and complete TODO.md should eventually also be
created.

Please indicate your intent to work on something in the Charter
prior to working on it so that we don't end up with wasted code and
energy.

## Questions and Concerns

Feel free to end email to <ty@tyweb.us> with any ideas, questions or
feedback.

## Donations

Gateway is accepting donations to fund development and accelerate
adoption.
