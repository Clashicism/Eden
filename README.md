# Gateway

Simple Bitcoin Payments

## A Note on This Repository

Until further notice, the contents of this repository and codebase are private
and proprietary. As a contributor, you are not permitted to grant access to
others to view this repo, and you are not permitted to give your access to
anybody else or share code.

The reason for this is that Gateway is a new project, and we need to build a
network effect. While the plan is to open-source eventually, we cannot have
others copying our website when UX and frictionlessness is our primary means of
attracting new merchants, customers and developers.

If you know of someone who you think could help with the project, contact the
maintainer <ty@tyweb.us> and we can go from there. Thank you for your
understanding.

## Overview

The project is a payment processor enabling merchants to easily accept Bitcoin
Cash on their sites without hassle or technical debt.

## Development

A list of things that need doing is available on this Google Doc:

A more traditional and complete TODO.md is on my TODO list :)

Please go on the Google Doc and indicate your intent to work on something prior
to working on it so that we don't end up with wasted code and energy.

Please let me know if you have ideas or questions.
