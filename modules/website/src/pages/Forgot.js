    <p>
      To recover your password, send an email to passwordreset@gateway.cash.
      In your email, include a signed Bitcoin message from the address you
      used to create your Gateway merchant account. Mention potato salad in
      your message so we know this is a legitimate request. We will send you
      an email with further instructions within 48 hours.
