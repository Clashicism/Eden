# Project Charter

## Overview

Gateway is a Bitcoin Cash payment processor designed to make accepting Bitcoin Cash payments a frictionless experience for merchants, customers and website owners across the internet.

We provide an easy-to-navigate interface for creating and managing Bitcoin Cash payment buttons, viewing payments and changing account settings. Merchants can add payment with Bitcoin Cash to their websites by simply copying some HTML, and customers can pay in under 15 seconds.

#### Where We Are

Currently, the gateway.cash website allows for merchants to create basic payment buttons, add them to their sites and accept payments. Transactions are near-instant and the user experience is as it should be--simple and seamless.

#### Where We Want to Go

Gateway strives to be the payment processor for the web. It sounds ambitious, we know, but we think we can get there if enough people start using it and adding it to their sites. With a single, standard, easy-to-use, frictionless and instant way to make and receive payments, people worldwide will also be able to enjoy the additional countless benefits of Bitcoin Cash.

#### How We Plan to Get There: Start Small

Within the Bitcoin Cash and wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, a strong demand exists driven by early adopters and intrigued merchants for an elegant and versatile payments solution that can be used anywhere.

With their support as a strong foundation, our first goal is to get cryptocurrency-oriented websites on board by promoting our tipping and donation buttons as a source of passive income. As sites like https://feecalculator.cash/ and https://tyweb.us/ demonstrate, once these buttons start popping up around the web people will take a liking to the straightforward experience.

It will be in the best interest of merchants if they provide a seamless and standard experience, so the goal is for gateway.cash to become the experience the BCH community converges on. Customers will recognize the familiar interface, preferring merchants who make payments simple and easy.

As such, the best thing you can do as someone who knows about Gateway is to inform others. If you know of merchants or website owners who might be interested, tell them. As the network effect of the project grows, so too will the influence it has over larger players considering whether to accept Bitcoin Cash.

## Profitability

We see Gateway as a fundamental building block for a large number of other profitable projects. Pioneering an open standard for payments will incentivize others to compete on top of our platform.

## Use Cases

Once this technology gets built, secure Bitcoin Payment buttons have many applications across the web:
Micropayments on social networking websites can be used to incentivize good content and build better online communities and platforms.
A simple, unified and standard way to pay for goods and services across shopping sites and apps will reduce friction and make purchases easy.
