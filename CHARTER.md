# Project Charter

## Overview

Gateway is a payment processor designed to make accepting Bitcoin Cash payments a frictionless experience for merchants, customers and website owners across the internet.

We provide an easy-to-navigate interface for creating and managing Bitcoin Cash payment buttons, viewing payments and changing account settings. Merchants can add payment with Bitcoin Cash to their websites by simply copying some HTML, and customers can pay in under 15 seconds.

#### Where We Are

The gateway.cash website allows for merchants to create advanced payment buttons, add them to their sites and accept BCH payments in denominations of any number of fiat currencies. Transactions are near-instant and the user experience is as it should be--simple and seamless. XPUB support allows for decentralization, and payment tracking allows shopkeepers and merchants to stay in control of their finances.

#### Where We Want to Go

Gateway strives to be the payment processor for the web. It sounds ambitious, we know, but we think we can get there if enough people start using it and adding it to their sites. With a single, standard, easy-to-use, frictionless and instant way to make and receive payments, people worldwide will also be able to enjoy the additional countless benefits of Bitcoin Cash.

#### How We Plan to Get There: Start Small

Within the Bitcoin Cash and wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, a strong demand exists driven by early adopters and intrigued merchants for an elegant and versatile payments solution that can be used anywhere.

With their support as a strong foundation, our first goal is to get cryptocurrency-oriented websites on board by promoting our tipping and donation buttons as a source of passive income. As sites like https://feecalculator.cash/ and https://tyweb.us/ demonstrate, once these buttons start popping up around the web people will take a liking to the straightforward experience.

It will be in the best interest of merchants if they provide a seamless and standard experience, so the goal is for gateway.cash to become the experience the BCH community converges on. Customers will recognize the familiar interface, preferring merchants who make payments simple and easy.

As such, the best thing you can do as someone who knows about Gateway is to inform others. If you know of merchants or website owners who might be interested, tell them. As the network effect of the project grows, so too will the influence it has over larger players considering whether to accept Bitcoin Cash.

## Profitability

We see Gateway as a fundamental building block for a large number of other profitable projects. Pioneering an open standard for payments will incentivize others to compete on top of our platform.

## Use Cases

Secure Bitcoin Cash Payment buttons have many applications across the web:

- Micropayments: There are many websites, apps and entire industries that could benefit from integration with a micropayment service provider. In these cases, Gateway aims not only to solve the problems these services face, but also to bring the countless other benefits of a standard, universal and frictionless platform. Because Gateway is built on top of Bitcoin Cash, these services also gain the benefits of immutability and censorship resistance.

- Decentralized content syndication platforms: passing time has only served to confirm warnings voiced and concerns raised by prominent software developers and early internet pioneers; centralized content distribution systems and networks like Facebook have inherent weaknesses which present severe dangers to society. The development of decentralized solutions driven by free markets rather than central planners will solve these problems. These systems are required to incorporate payment technologies to manage content, fund creators and curate content. Gateway aims to serve as an open protocol on top of which these new networks can operate in a secure, transparent, decentralized, standard and cross-compatible manner.

- Online retail: large and centralized marketplaces who treat merchants unfairly and charge exorbitant fees have come to dominate the digital retail industry. Gateway serves as an essential building block for new, market-driven networks that level the playing field for small online sellers. As new, open and standard inventory management solutions are developed, Gateway can automate the payment process, streamlining merchant workflow and lowering fees.

- Trustless payment-channel-based content streaming solutions: a rising content creator demand exists for platforms that compensate them fairly. While this also falls under the category of content syndication, sites leveraging video streaming and payment channels will disrupt a different--though related--industry.

## Execution

Revolutionary ideas and great products are paralyzed without a strong team and the strategic execution needed to make them happen. Since we’re an open standard, all our operations are public. There are weekly meetings on the Bitcoin Cash Association Discord voice channel every Saturday at 9AM PST.

Code is committed to the GitHub repo, and anyone is invited to collaborate. 

## Financing

In order to do quality work, team members need to be incentivized to spend time and do things right. That means building scalable, robust and thoroughly documented code meant to last for generations. These things take time, and spending time has high opportunity cost.

In order that we may recruit the best developers and compensate them fairly, Gateway has established a donation address jointly controlled by prominent project contributors. Donations are used to provide bounties for code, payment for developers and funding for projects in the Gateway Ecosystem.

## Ecosystem

As Gateway has grown in popularity and usability, an ecosystem of related projects and applications has emerged. These projects often have competing interests, but they all have one thing in common—the need for a simple payment experience:

### Marketplace

Marketplace.cash aims to be a decentralized platform for buying and selling. By bridging OpenBazaar and the web browser, it aims to simplify the experience for buyers and sellers.

### Embed

Embed.cash aims to be a simple place where publishers, photographers and writers can earn Bitcoin Cash for their content. Users upload pictures, videos, music or even just text, and Embed will deliver the content to users for a small micropayment fee.

### CashFlow

For merchants and businesses who need more than just a button, cashflow.fm aims to provide an integrated payment experience, including integration with the largest online shopping sites like Shopify, WooCommerce and WordPress.

### Unite

Unite.cash aims to be a censorship-resistant media sharing protocol built on the blockchain and IPFS. Hierarchical trees of transactions form networks and micropayments will be facilitated with Gateway.

### CoffeeCoinFlip

One of the first use-cases envisioned by cryptocurrency enthusiasts was buying coffee with their Bitcoin. While it’s true that some coffee shops now accept the digital asset, it’s generally pretty hard to find one in most places around the world. CoffeeCoinFlip aims to change the incentives and make this vision a reality.

### Others

Gateway also has the support of numerous other projects and services across the industry. The Bitcoin Cash Association has helped us to grow by connecting us with great people, and coin.dance has provided helpful feedback on helping us build a great product.

## Gateway Platforms

Many of the projects in the above list will come to rely on Gateway Platforms. Platforms is a feature allowing website operators and developers to operate proprietary, closed-source services utilizing the Gateway technology and still earn a profit.

The open-source Gateway server infrastructure comes with support for “Platforms users”, which are accounts that belong to a specific platform. Payments made to these accounts are subject to commissions imposed by platform administrators.

Any normal (non-platform) user can make a platform. They can add or remove commissions, view users and perform other administrative tasks.

## Compatibility

We understand that we aren’t the only project trying to disrupt the financial services industry. We do what we can to maintain compatibility with our friends working on other solutions, in the hope that when things are said and done, one standard exists for payments instead of two.

We are fully compatible with Badger Wallet and the Badger Button, both of which are helping to spread Bitcoin Cash adoption worldwide. For users with the Badger Wallet installed in their browser, the experience is actually greater than the sum of the parts because the one-click functionality of Badger is combined with the instant feedback from Gateway and our payment tracking features.
